# 🚗 U Cab – Smart IoT-Based Car Rental System

**U Cab** is an intelligent, real-time vehicle rental control and monitoring system. It combines embedded systems, telematics, and cloud integration to automate the rental process, enforce mileage-based access control, and ensure vehicle safety. Designed for rental agencies and individual vehicle owners, this device transforms any vehicle into a smart, self-managing rental unit.

## 🔧 Project Overview

The U Cab system is composed of a custom hardware module and two mobile applications (Owner and Customer apps). Once installed in a vehicle, it connects to the ECU via **OBD2 CAN bus**, collects critical data like engine status, speed, and mileage, and uploads it to a remote server using **GSM (SIM800L)**.

Customers can book mileage packages via the app, and once their mileage limit is exhausted, the car is automatically disabled using a **power relay**. Owners can track vehicle status, location, and remotely control the vehicle from anywhere.

## 🗺️ Use Case: Car Rental Process

1. **Owner installs** the U Cab device in the vehicle via the OBD2 port.
2. **Customer books** mileage via the mobile app and makes a payment.
3. **Device starts tracking** vehicle metrics in real-time (mileage, speed, engine status).
4. When the **purchased mileage limit is reached**, the car is **automatically disabled**.
5. **Owner app** receives full status updates, live GPS location, and diagnostic data.
6. The **vehicle can be re-enabled** manually or by purchasing additional mileage.
